  <h1 id="a3">Mythbuster: Superstitions Surrounding Wild  Animals.</h1> <br><br>

</div>

<div id="a4">

  We were all told tales as children ‚Äì many of which are considered superstition and relatively harmless. <br>
   Growing up in India, we‚Äôve often heard things like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt stray across the path of a black cat,‚Äù or ‚Äúan itch on <br>
    the palm means wealth is headed your way‚Äù and the like. <br>

Amongst many others, our country‚Äôs wildlife has faced a rising threat from superstitious beliefs over the <br>
 years, and these are far from innocuous. From the belief that elephant tusks and elephant hair bring good <br>
  luck to the faith that sacrificing owls in rituals can bring fortune ‚Äì many such concepts continue to exist <br>
   even today, endangering the lives of countless wild animals across the country. This can affect entire <br>
   ecosystems, and despite a strong legal framework in place, these unfortunate practices continue under the radar. <br> <br>

Here are some commonly believed superstitions that affect some of the animals‚Äô Wildlife SOS works with: <br> <br>

<b> Bengal Tiger: </b>The claws of a tiger are believed to bring good luck, and the genitals are believed to be <br>
 aphrodisiacs. Tiger pelts are in great demand in the black market and so are their teeth and whiskers, <br>
  which are said to ‚Äòward off the evil eye‚Äô. <br> <br>

The Bengal Tiger is protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 but despite the strong <br>
level of protection granted by the law of the land, these big cats continue to fall prey to threats such as jaw <br> 
traps, snares, electrocution, poisoning and illegal wildlife trade. Our anti-poaching unit ‚ÄòForestWatch‚Äô has <br>
 assisted enforcement authorities in busting many poachers in the past resulting in the recovery of tiger <br>
  skins, claws and other wildlife contraband from these traffickers. <br><br>

<br> <br> <br>
  <div id="a7">

   <b> Red Sand Boa: </b> Red sand boas have various superstitious myths and beliefs attributed to them because of <br>
     their double-headed appearance and are often referred to as ‚ÄúDo muha‚Äù in Hindi. <br> <br>

This particular snake species is in danger of mass smuggling as there is a very high demand for them in  <br>
China and Nepal, and even in western countries. In India, where the superstitious practice of snake <br>
charming still exists, people are often misguiding into believing that a sighting of these ‚Äòtwo-headed‚Äô snakes  <br>
can bring good luck to households. These snakes are highly coveted and sold in the country‚Äôs black markets <br>
 because of such blind faith. Red sand boas are protected under Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.  <br> <br>

Every year, especially during the month of Shravan (monsoon), Wildlife SOS rescues countless snakes <br>
 in terrible conditions from snake charmers and rehabilitates them into their natural habitats upon recovery. <br> <br> <br> <br>

  <div id="b1">
    <b> Cobra snake:</b> The Cobra is one of the most revered animal species in India, and at the same time highly <br> 
    feared as it is one of the deadliest snakes found in the country. There is also a long string of baseless <br>
    beliefs attached to their existence leading to escalating incidents of conflict with humans. A major part of <br>
    the superstition stems from snake charmers who use cruel methods such as sewing and taping the mouth <br>
    of the snake, or by breaking their fangs in order to render them ‚Äúsafe‚Äù or ‚Äúharmless‚Äù. <br> <br> 

    Every Naga Panchami, cobra snakes are offered milk in the belief that they will drink it. In reality, snakes <br>
     cannot digest milk at all! Their venom glands are often brutally removed by snake charmers so that they  <br>
     can be exhibited to large crowds ‚Äì confused and dehydrated. The Cobra snake is protected under Schedule <br>
      II of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. <br> <br>
    
    Wildlife SOS is well-equipped to deal with rescues involving highly venomous snakes like the Cobra. <br>
     Countless Cobras are still found languishing, neglected, starved and dehydrated, in snake charmers‚Äô  <br>
     baskets, their venom glands and fangs brutally mutilated or removed to reduce the dangers to the handler. <br> <br>
  </div>

  <div id="b2">

 <b> Indian Star Tortoise:</b> The Indian star tortoise is considered to be a symbol of good luck. It is also believed<br>
   to hold great value in traditional eastern medicine and its meat is considered a delicacy in other places,<br>
    thus making it a highly coveted option for poachers looking to make a quick buck. Every year, tens of<br>
     thousands of star tortoises are poached from the wild and smuggled via railway, airplanes, or even ships<br>
      nationally and globally. There is also a high demand for Indian Star tortoises in the exotic pet trade as they<br>
       have a unique star-like radiating pattern on their carapace (shell). <br><br>

This species is protected under Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and is listed as ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô <br>
by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). At the 2019 CITES summit, they were moved<br>
 from Appendix II to Appendix I status after a vote by a majority by nations participating in CITES. While <br>
 hopes soar that these measures can provide more protection to the tortoise both in India, where it‚Äôs illegal<br>
  to own or trade them commercially, and internationally, worries persist due to the recent spike in the trade <br>
  surrounding the species. <br> <br>

Wildlife SOS has successfully released 51 Indian star tortoises that are part of our Indian Star Tortoise<br>
 Repatriation Project into their native habitats and has been monitoring them through a unique and<br>
  innovative satellite telemetry study. These star tortoises were confiscated by authorities in Singapore,<br>
   luckily before they were put on the black market to be sold as pets or food. <br> <br>

As a part of the research study, factors like health condition, body weight, behaviour patterns, adaptation <br>
to wild foraging etc are also being documented. The research team also tracks and monitor the movements<br>
 and ranging patterns of the tortoises. <br> <br>

  <b> Golden Jackal:</b> Very popular on illicit online markets, the ‚Äòjackal horn‚Äô is a talisman derived from the skull <br>
  of a golden jackal. While conservation efforts are broadly focussed on more ‚Äòcharismatic‚Äô species like tigers, <br>
  lesser noticed animals like India‚Äôs golden jackals are facing the brunt of a more niche superstitious demand. <br>
  The ‚Äòjackal horn‚Äô is believed to be a talisman to ward off ‚Äòthe evil eye‚Äô and protect the wearer. Apart from <br>
  this, jackal skins and tails are also in great demand.<br><br>

Wildlife SOS frequently rescues Golden Jackals caught in conflict situations, trapped in borewells and from<br>
 poachers‚Äô snare and jaw traps. These traps are a very cruel way of trapping animals and often lead to<br>
  grievous injuries or fatalities.<br><br>

  <b> Leopards:</b> The myths around big cats are fairly common, and the same is the case with the Indian leopard. <br>
  Everything from its teeth to skin is considered to hold different mystical properties. People believe that<br>
   keeping the teeth on one‚Äôs person offers protection and brings money. Leopards are accorded protection <br>
   under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.<br><br>

  Wildlife SOS‚Äô anti-poaching unit ‚ÄòForestWatch‚Äô has enabled the capture of many illegal leopard poachers <br>
  through a vast network of informers and providing aid to enforcement authorities. Leopard skins and teeth<br>
   are some of the contraband seized from these wildlife traffickers.<br><br>
